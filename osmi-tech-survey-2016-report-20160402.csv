Luckily he made a joke about not talking about the shrooms he did to lighten that one, but there were many worse situations.  I was considered one of the most valued employees because of my ability to get anything done with the LLVM compiler system.  One day I pointed out to the manager in question that he was on a higher dosage of the same medication I was on, and the stupid meth jokes got worse from there.
